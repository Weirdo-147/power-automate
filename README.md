## About Images

Throughout the documentation, you'll notice image references like:

![Image Title](images/image-name.png)
```

These are placeholder references for images that should be added to the `images` directory. To complete the documentation with proper visuals:

### Options for Adding Images

1. **Download Official Screenshots**: 
   - Capture relevant screenshots from the Power Automate interface
   - Save them to the `images` folder using the referenced filenames

2. **Create Custom Diagrams**:
   - Create explanatory diagrams for concepts and workflows
   - Use tools like Visio, Draw.io, or PowerPoint
   - Export as PNG files to the `images` folder

3. **Use Microsoft Documentation Images**:
   - Some images may be available from Microsoft's official documentation
   - Ensure proper attribution and usage rights

4. **Replace with Direct URLs**:
   - Alternatively, replace the local image references with direct URLs to online images
   - Example: `![Image Title](https://example.com/path/to/image.png)`
